    print("🧪 Testing Improved Loading State Logic")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    print("\n📋 The Problem:")
    print("  - Fixed 1-second delay regardless of data availability")
    print("  - Could show '0m' even when data was ready")
    print("  - Could wait unnecessarily when data was already populated")
    print("  - Not responsive to actual data state")
    
    print("\n💡 The Solution:")
    print("  - Wait for data to be actually populated")
    print("  - Check if settings and usage data are valid")
    print("  - Update immediately if data is ready")
    print("  - Poll every 100ms until data is available")
    print("  - Maximum wait time: until data is ready")
    
    print("\n🔍 New Function: waitForDataAndUpdate()")
    print("  - Checks if currentSettings.dailyLimit > 0")
    print("  - Checks if dailyUsage is defined and >= 0")
    print("  - Updates immediately if data is valid")
    print("  - Polls every 100ms if data isn't ready")
    print("  - Logs progress for debugging")
    
    print("\n📊 Data Validation Logic:")
    print("  const hasValidData = () => {")
    print("    return currentSettings &&")
    print("           currentSettings.dailyLimit &&")
    print("           currentSettings.dailyLimit > 0 &&")
    print("           dailyUsage !== undefined &&")
    print("           dailyUsage >= 0;")
    print("  };")
    
    print("\n🔄 Polling Logic:")
    print("  - If data is valid → update immediately")
    print("  - If data is not valid → wait 100ms and check again")
    print("  - Continues until data is populated")
    print("  - No maximum wait time (waits until ready)")
    
    print("\n🧪 How to Test:")
    print("  1. Open a monitored site")
    print("  2. Check console for '⏳ Waiting for data to be populated...'")
    print("  3. Watch for data validation messages")
    print("  4. Should see '✅ Data populated, updating indicator' when ready")
    print("  5. No more fixed 1-second delays!")
    
    print("\n🔍 Console Messages to Look For:")
    print("  ⏳ Waiting for data to be populated...")
    print("  ✅ Data already populated, updating immediately")
    print("  ⏳ Still waiting for data... (dailyLimit: 30, dailyUsage: 0)")
    print("  ✅ Data populated, updating indicator")
    print("  ✅ Force updated indicator with limit: 30 and time: 0")
    
    print("\n💡 Benefits:")
    print("  ✅ Responsive to actual data state")
    print("  ✅ No unnecessary waiting")
    print("  ✅ Immediate updates when data is ready")
    print("  ✅ Better user experience")
    print("  ✅ More efficient resource usage")
