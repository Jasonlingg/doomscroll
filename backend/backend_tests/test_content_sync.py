    print("🧪 Testing Content Script Settings Sync")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    print("\n📋 The Problem:")
    print("  - Popup wasn't syncing with local storage correctly")
    print("  - Backend sync was complex and unreliable")
    print("  - Content script had correct settings but popup couldn't access them")
    
    print("\n💡 The Solution:")
    print("  - Get settings directly from active content script")
    print("  - Content script has the most up-to-date settings")
    print("  - Fallback to local storage if no content script")
    print("  - No more complex backend sync for popup loading")
    
    print("\n📊 New Loading Flow:")
    print("  1. Check if form already has values (skip if loaded)")
    print("  2. Get active tab")
    print("  3. Request settings from content script")
    print("  4. Update popup form with content script settings")
    print("  5. Fallback to local storage if no content script")
    
    print("\n🔍 Content Script Handler:")
    print("  - Added 'getSettings' message handler")
    print("  - Returns current settings + monitored websites")
    print("  - Gets monitored websites from storage")
    print("  - Sends complete settings object")
    
    print("\n🧪 How to Test:")
    print("  1. Open a monitored site (e.g., Instagram)")
    print("  2. Change settings in popup (e.g., daily limit to 60)")
    print("  3. Close popup and reopen")
    print("  4. Check console for '🔍 Getting settings from active content script...'")
    print("  5. Settings should load immediately from content script")
    
    print("\n🔍 Console Messages to Look For:")
    print("  🔍 Getting settings from active content script...")
    print("  📥 Got settings from content script: {...}")
    print("  ✅ Settings loaded from content script")
    print("  🌐 Settings source: Content script")
    print("  ⚙️ Settings requested from popup, sending current settings: {...}")
    print("  📤 Sending settings to popup: {...}")
    
    print("\n💡 Benefits:")
    print("  ✅ Instant loading (no storage/backend delays)")
    print("  ✅ Always up-to-date (content script has latest)")
    print("  ✅ Simple and reliable")
    print("  ✅ Works even if backend is down")
    print("  ✅ No complex sync logic needed")
